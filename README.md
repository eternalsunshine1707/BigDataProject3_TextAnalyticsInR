# <u> CSCI 6444: INTRODUCTION TO BIG DATA &amp; ANALYTICS </u>
# Project 3: Text Analytics In R
<p align="center"><u><b>Project Description</b></u></p>
For this project, our dataset consists of a text file containing segments extracted from the
renowned literary work "Tarzan of the Apes" authored by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The selected
corpus encompasses chapters I through XV of the novel. This decision was made to focus our
text analytics efforts on a substantial yet manageable portion of the text, facilitating in-depth
exploration and analysis within the scope of this project. 

The objective of this project is to conduct text analytics on the extensive text file " Tarzan of
the Apes." Through a series of analytical methods, we aim to delve into the text's content,
discern underlying sentiments, and draw insightful observations. By employing various text
mining techniques, we seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of the narrative, its
thematic elements, and any implicit sentiments expressed within the text. Ultimately, this
analysis endeavors to extract valuable insights and contribute to a deeper comprehension of the
literary work "Tarzan of the Apes." 

This project has provided invaluable hands-on experience with text analytics, offering a
comprehensive journey through the exploration of textual data. While following a structured
path outlined in the rubric, we encountered numerous challenges that enriched our
understanding of text analytics. Dealing with multiple documents, accommodating large text,
and mitigating sparsity were just a few of the obstacles we encountered. These challenges
illuminated the empirical nature of data science, emphasizing the importance of practical
experience in navigating real-world data complexities. Through the exploration of data in this
project, we've gained valuable insights into the intricacies of natural language processing
(NLP) and the diverse challenges it presents. One key aspect we've learned is the importance
of preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization in preparing
textual data for analysis. These techniques not only help standardize text but also enable more
accurate analysis by reducing noise and capturing the essence of the text.

One of the fundamental lessons gleaned from this project is the critical role of data
preprocessing in text analytics. By cleaning the data, and removing stop words, punctuation,
and quotation marks, we recognized the significance of preparing the data before analysis. By
eliminating extraneous elements that do not contribute to the analysis, we ensured the integrity
and accuracy of our insights. Moreover, we explored various packages for text analytics within
R, uncovering their diverse capabilities such as generating word clouds, extracting information,
and assigning sentiments. Through these analyses, we pieced together a coherent understanding
of the textual data, despite its initial complexity.

The Text Analytics project served as a significant learning opportunity, consolidating the
knowledge acquired from previous projects and enhancing our proficiency in various aspects
of analytics. It played a pivotal role in refining our approaches, thought processes, and
troubleshooting skills, further solidifying our foundation in analytics. Moreover, the project
underscored the convenience and effectiveness of using R for conducting comprehensive data
analytics, reaffirming its position as a powerful tool in this domain.

In summary, completing this project has left us feeling confident and competent in utilizing R
for a multitude of tasks, including text analytics on large datasets, data cleaning, information
extraction, and visualization generation. We now possess the capability to interpret sentiments,
apply diverse functions and metrics to analyze documents and draw insightful conclusions
about the underlying problem domain. Additionally, the project has equipped us with the skills
to streamline and simplify text for more efficient analysis, further enhancing our ability to
extract meaningful insights from textual data.
